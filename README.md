# Diabetes-Prediction-Analysis
This repository contains code for analyzing diabetes prediction using various machine learning models. It demonstrates the application of different classification techniques to evaluate their performance on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. The goal is to identify the most effective model for predicting diabetes.

The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, originally provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository and accessed through Kaggle, has been used in this analysis. The dataset was collected from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It includes medical variables such as pregnancy history, BMI, insulin levels, age, glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, and the diabetes pedigree function. The dataset contains data from 768 female patients who are at least 21 years old. Among these patients, 268 (34.90%) have been diagnosed with diabetes, while 500 (65.10%) have not.

In this study, I employed seven classification techniques: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Na√Øve Bayes (NB), and Gradient Boosting (GB). Each model was evaluated using cross-validation to determine the best-performing model. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model achieved the highest accuracy based on cross-validation scores, indicating its effectiveness in predicting diabetes in this dataset. Various preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and scaling the data, were applied to optimize the performance of these models.
